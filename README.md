# Project_3: Hotel.io

## Overview & Features

Did you know that almost 20% of hotels rooms booked online are cancelled before the guest arrives? This not only directly impacts the revenue, but also leads to poor marketing, since Online Travel Agencies keep track of cancellations drawn by a hotel. The Hotel.io platform addresses this problem by creating and implementing the following features:

1) A UI from which users can buy, sell, or swap hotel room bookings
An integration with Booking.com using the rapidAPI in order to obtain real-time hotel pricing from hotels such as The Marriot, Sheridan, 4 Seasons, Courtyard among others
2) Smart contracts that mint NFTs the moment a hotel room is purchased
3) Smart contracts that create rules around and facilitate the trading, buying and selling of rooms in the event that plans change last minute for a guest

### NOTE

* A subscription to utilize rapidAPI is needed in order to succesfully run the application

## Technologies

The Hotel.io marketplace utilizes Python (v 3.9.7) and the following libraries:

## Installation Guide

Majority of the above libraries should be part of the base applications that were installed with the Python version above; if not, you will have to install them through the pip package manager of Python.

## Application Sections

## Development Pipeline

Upon succesful deployment of the Hotel.io platform, we aim to create a NFT / Smart Contract system to not only allow trading of hotel rooms within a secondary market, but also to create secondary marketplaces for airfaires, car rentals and airbnbs.
